    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>⅓ cup butter</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>4 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Filling:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>½ cup raisins</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Glaze:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon light corn syrup</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons half-and-half cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from
        heat. Add the butter and stir until melted; let cool until lukewarm.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in the milk mixture. Add the
        sugar, 3 cups of flour, salt and eggs; stir well to combine. Add the
        remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition.
        When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured
        surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly oil a large mixing bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to
        coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place
        until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and
        roll into a 10x 14 inch rectangle. Lightly brush the far edge with
        water. In a small bowl combine the cinnamon and 3/4 cup brown sugar and
        sprinkle over the rectangles. Then sprinkle the raisins and chopped nuts
        over the dough. Roll up the dough into a log and seal the seam.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the dough into 12 equal pieces; place the pieces in a greased 9x13
        inch baking pan, or 12 inch deep dish pizza pan. Cover with plastic wrap
        and place in the refrigerator to rise overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        The next morning, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Take
        the rolls out of the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for
        30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the rolls for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden. Meanwhile, combine
        the corn syrup with the vanilla in a small bowl. Whisk in the powdered
        sugar and enough cream to make a thick glaze; set aside. Drizzle the
        glaze over the rolls and serve warm.
